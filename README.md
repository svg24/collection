# Collection

Collection of logos, optimized to be rendered at 24x24*.

## Intro

For each logo has own directory, in which can be stored several versions. The filename is formed according to the following mask: `name-version-type`, where:

- `name` it's the name of product;
- `version` it's the date the logo was adopted with `v` as prefix;
- `type` it's the logo type.

## Optimization

The first step is to optimize the logo using SVGO â€” this is necessary in order to make the subsequent manual work more comfortable. The next step is manual optimization in the vector editor of what was not processed in the previous step. And finally, the logo once again optimize using SVGO with more gentle plugins.

## Types

For convenience, in the collection, each logo is presented in two types:

|                                                         Original                                                          |                                                        Square                                                         |
